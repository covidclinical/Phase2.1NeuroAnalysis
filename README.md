# Analysis of COVID-19 & Acute Neurological Manifestations

## **Data pre-processing**

1.  `01_healthcare-system-metadata.Rmd` - computes the number of adult and pediatric patients at each healthcare system.

    a\. Used for **Supplementary Table 1. Description of participating healthcare systems**

    b\. Also reviewed information from the [4CE Health Systems Participating google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xl9juDBXt86P3xQtsoTaBl2zPl1BIiAG9DI3Rotyqp8/edit#gid=212461777) on Dec 26, 2022

2.  `02_demographic-preprocess.Rmd` - processes the demographic data by healthcare system.

    a\. Used to generate **Figure 2. Demographic profile at each participating healthcare system**

    b\. Figure 2 is generated by subsequently running `/demographic-figure/demographics.R` and creating final touch ups using Keynote on Mac iOS.

3.  `03_comorbidity-preprocess.Rmd` - this pre-processes the comorbidity data by healthcare system.

    *Of note, this script reads in healthcare system data stored in the `results_comorbidity/`. After having sites run the initital package, I realized I forgot to include one of the comorbidity tables in the output. For this reason, sites reran just the comorbidity analysis and generated the `[site]_comorb_results.rda` file. In some cases, sites reran the full code (thus, generating the typical `[site]_results.rda` file) and I subsequently manually changed the name of the .rda file to be consistent and allow this script to remain streamlined.*

## **Analysis**

1.  `04_Patient-Characteristics.Rmd` - generate preliminary demographics, clinical course, and comorbidity analyses
