## **Patient Population**

Our study leverages a multinational study of > 106,000 hospitalized COVID-19 adult and pediatric positive patients from 21 healthcare systems across 6 countries. We examined and report the clinical health outcomes (length of hospital stay and mortality) of COVID-19 patients with concurrent neurological diagnoses.

Specifically, we used ICD codes to stratify patients into three groups of patients with 1) no neurological condition (NNC), 2) a central nervous system condition (CNS), or 3) a peripheral nervous system condition (PNS):
